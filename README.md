# APIwBouman
Bouman-Johnson Housing Project

This app is useful for valuing any Belgian real estate. It works with an [API](https://github.com/orhannurkan/API-deployment).

This project is a collaboration between two learners from BeCode (Brussels) : [Eva Mlg](https://github.com/EvaMlg) and [Christophe Giets](https://github.com/gietsc). EvaMlg developps the app with the API Christophe developps. 

Pendings things to do : The HTML form is not fully finish (some of field are missing, and some connection with the API not workind yet), and the CSS could be better (he always can, right?)
